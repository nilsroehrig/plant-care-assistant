# Plant Care Assistant

Demo project for the talk "Building Dynamic Web Apps with SvelteKit and Firebase".
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server and the firebase emulator suite:

```bash
npm run emu
```

The Vite development server is accessible at [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). To view it in a version closer to firebase, use the hosting emulator at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Deployment

To create a production version of your app and deploy it to firebase:

```bash
firebase deploy
```
